# Telkomsel Indihome Tower Performance Dashboard

Power BI dashboard analyzing Indihome broadband tower performance for Telkomsel, Indonesia‚Äôs leading telecom provider. Focuses on identifying underperforming towers to optimize network efficiency, service alignment, and infrastructure ROI.

This project showcases a real-world Power BI dashboard created during my time working as a data analyst intern at **Telkomsel**, one of Indonesia‚Äôs largest telecommunications providers. The dashboard analyzes the performance of **Indihome** towers‚ÄîIndihome being Telkomsel‚Äôs broadband internet and digital service brand.

The goal was to identify underperforming towers generating less than IDR 30 million in monthly revenue, providing insights to optimize service alignment, infrastructure deployment, and network efficiency.

## üîë Key Metrics Tracked

- **Revenue Category**  
  Categorizes tower performance by revenue tiers (e.g., <30 million IDR, 30‚Äì60 million, >60 million).

- **Package Type**  
  Identifies whether each tower is assigned to a service package under the Indihome brand. Towers without packages often lack focused marketing or support.

- **Coverage Type**  
  Indicates if the tower is installed **indoor** (e.g., malls, hotels) or **outdoor** (e.g., rooftops, public areas).

- **Payload Usage**  
  Total amount of data transmitted by the tower, measured in gigabytes (GB). A key performance indicator of user engagement.

## üìä Summary of Insights

1. **High Payload, Low Revenue Disconnect**  
   Most towers generating less than IDR 30 million monthly revenue actually transmit over 23.5K GB of data.  
   _Interpretation_: Despite heavy usage, monetization may be weak due to pricing strategy, user segmentation, or bundled services.

2. **Non-Package Towers Miss Potential**  
   A sizable share of underperforming towers are not attached to any commercial package.  
   _Interpretation_: These towers may serve active users, but lack structured offers that convert usage into revenue.

3. **Outdoor Towers Dominate This Segment**  
   The under-30M IDR group is heavily skewed toward outdoor towers.  
   _Interpretation_: Outdoor sites may be serving high-traffic public areas but with low revenue yield per GB.

4. **Western Region Carries Most of the Low Revenue Load**  
   Western region shows the highest number of sites in the high-payload but low-revenue category.  
   _Interpretation_: There may be unbalanced pricing or market saturation issues that limit monetization.

## üöÄ Recommendations & Next Steps

- **Recalibrate Pricing & Package Strategy**  
  Focus on high-payload, low-revenue towers and explore premium tiering, usage-based pricing, or unbundling where feasible.

- **Activate Non-Package Sites with Offers**  
  Assign clear packages or promo bundles to towers currently running without structured commercial plans.

- **Investigate Revenue Leakages**  
  Conduct revenue assurance audits on sites with high traffic but low income to identify technical or commercial leak points.

- **Segment by User Type & Context**  
  Determine whether these towers serve heavy but unprofitable users (e.g., public Wi-Fi, bulk resellers) and tailor offerings accordingly.

- **Run Region-Specific Optimization in Western Area**  
  Pilot interventions in the Western region, targeting top-traffic but underperforming towers to measure commercial uplift.
